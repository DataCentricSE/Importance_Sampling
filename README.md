# Model-centric Integration of Uncertain Expert Knowledge into Importance Sampling-based Parameter Estimation

This study presents a model-based parameter estimation method for integrating and validating uncertainty in expert knowledge and simulation models.
The parameters of the models of complex systems are often unknown due to lack of measurement data. Experience-based knowledge of experts can substitute missing information, which is usually imprecise. 
The novelty of the present paper is a method based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and importance sampling (IS) techniques for integrating uncertain expert knowledge into the system model. Uncertain knowledge about the model parameters is propagated through the system model by MC simulation in the form of a discrete sample, while IS helps to weight the sample elements regarding imprecise knowledge about the outputs in an iterative circle. Thereby, the consistency of expert judgments can be investigated, as well.
The contributions of the paper include an expert knowledge-based parameter estimation technique, and a method for the evaluation of expert judgments according to the estimation results to eliminate incorrect ones.
The applicability of the proposed method is introduced through a case study of a Hungarian operating waste separation system. 
The results verify that the assessments of experts can be efficiently integrated into system models, and the consistency of them can be evaluated.
